SimpleEncrypter
============
Implementing the RSA algorithm in Java.

It is able to:

+ Generate private/publick key pairs;
+ Encrypt and Decrypt (duh!);
+ Sign and verify signature;
+ Encrypt and Sign/Decrypt and verify signature.



## Contributing
Well, that would be awesome actually. You see, I know jack squat about Maven. My goal is to make
a boilerplate project from which I can learn about big ass projects with these.

So any help creating test cases, organizing the project, or pretty much ANYTHING is very welcomed.


## Disclaimer
This goes without saying, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS TO SECURE INFORMATION!!
It's just a rudimentary implementation of the RSA Algorithm (I kinda made it so I could learn more
about Java & Maven).


## Fun Facts
+ Private & Public keys are generated by serializing their respective classes. They will not resemble
the regular key pairs you are used to see
+ This project SHOULD be able to be used standalone (by using the base package com.fgarci03.simpleencrypter)
and as a module (by using the api package com.fgarci03.simpleencrypter.api). Not sure if this is a good practive?
+ I haven't yet extensively tested THE WHOLE thing, so shall it produce funny bugs, please report them (just
the funny ones please!)
